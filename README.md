# Why another web framework?

The main goal of clairity is to experiment and provide the infrastructure for a federated web application.

clairity doesn't aim to reinvent the wheel.
On the contrary, others have done that too already and have done it better.
clairity will reuse or fork proven, existing, components, that will help experimentation and faster development.

There is one thing that hasn't reached yet its potential: federating content by design,
in a web application such as as a user-posting blog or forum.


This is an experimental repository, testing concepts and implementations.
